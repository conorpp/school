I did the extra credit for this homework.

You can run the simulation with a variable amount of tellers

You can optionally specify the number of tellers as the 3rd argument to the executable.

TO COMPILE AND RUN:
    g++ simulate.cpp bank.cpp -o bank
    
    ./bank <inputfile> <outputfile> [<number-of-tellers>]
    
Where <number-of-tellers> will default to 1.
